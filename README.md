# Quick Learning Notes

- rnfs shortcut for boiler plate of react code

- In React Native, components like <Image />, <Text />, and <View /> are all independent elements with their own layout rules.
- ScrollView renders all its react child components at once, but this has a performance downside, whereas <FlatList> lazy loads the components, the one which are not in the view are not loaded.
